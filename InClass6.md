##Progressive enhancement Arguments
One of the strongest arguments defending the notion that progressive enhancement ought to be the traditional model where content is always accessible is the following quote:
>   In 2016, it’s okay to build a website that doesn’t work without JavaScript.


On the other hand, those who take the view that progressive enhancement has changed such that JS running on a browser can be safely assumed and that the network is now the enhancement will argue:

>I’m exasperated by this push to require JS / get rid of CSS…but I’m angry at the conferences promoting these ideas:

####My point of view
 Websites is mostly dependent on java script, as most of the fansy things are made by the help of java script in my point of view,besides big compnines, small companies use java script in their websites and it will be like this only because most people like java script.
